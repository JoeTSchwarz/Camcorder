This is a virtual camcorder that allows you to focus on a specific area of the screen and record the actions taking place in that area.
This package contains 4 source files written in JavaFX:
1) Camcoder.java: the main class
2) Display.java: the Diplay API to display the recorded/created GIF or GZIP files
3) GifIO.java: IO for saving/reading recorded .gif and .gzip files
4) Tools.java: Utilities
   
and 3 icons (sanduhr.gif, save.png, Camcoder.png) + gif.css and manifest.mf
Camcorder is based on Java and JavaFX. If your JDK version is less than 10 (best: JDK 8 or 9), you can compile the sources without any problem.
Otherwise, if your JDK is higher than 10, you need to download Open JavaFX according to your JDK version.
The manifest.mf file is for creating the JAR file using Java's jar utility

The animation “ArizonaColt.gif” shows you how Virtual Camcorder works with Focusing and Displayin. Camcorder is an intuitive Diaglog application.
